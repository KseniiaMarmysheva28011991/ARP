1068,184,"select p.product_name, s.year, s.price from (select distinct product_id, year, price from schema_1068.sales) as s join schema_1068.product as p on s.product_id = p.product_id","The query does not meet the LeetCode task requirements (Task 1068), as it applies a DISTINCT to the Sales table, which aggregates rows and removes duplicate combinations of product_id, year, and price. As a result, it loses the necessary granularity to report each individual sale_id, violating the requirement to return one row per sale."
1148,29,select distinct v1.author_id as id from schema_1148.views as v1 join schema_1148.views as v2 on (v1.article_id = v2.article_id and v1.author_id = v2.viewer_id) order by v1.author_id,The query does not meet the LeetCode task requirements (Task 1148) because it performs a self-join on article_id and additionally checks if v1.author_id = v2.viewer_id. This leads to incorrect logic since the task only requires comparing author_id and viewer_id within the same row.
1148,107,select distinct a.author_id as id from schema_1148.views as a join schema_1148.views as b on (a.article_id = b.article_id and a.author_id = b.viewer_id) order by a.author_id,The query does not meet the LeetCode task requirements (Task 1148) because it performs a self-join on article_id and additionally checks if v1.author_id = v2.viewer_id. This leads to incorrect logic since the task only requires comparing author_id and viewer_id within the same row.
1821,94,select customer_id from schema_1821.customers where (year = 2021 and revenue > 1),"The query does not meet the task requirements because it uses revenue > 1 instead of revenue > 0. The condition revenue > 1 will exclude customers whose revenue is exactly 1, even though the task specifies selecting customers with any positive revenue. "
